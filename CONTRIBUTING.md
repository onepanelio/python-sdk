# Contributing to Onepanel Core Python SDK
The code for the SDK is generated by [Openapi Generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator).

## Generating the SDK
You can generate the Python SDK by running:

```
make path=<path-to-swagger-file> version=<version>
```

`path` is the local path to [Onepanel Core API's swagger file](https://github.com/onepanelio/core/blob/master/api/api.swagger.json), example: `path=../core/api/api.swagger.json`

`version` is the version of the SDK, following [SemVer](https://semver.org), example: `version=0.5`
